# State-Augmented-Mutating-Particle-Filter
The novel particle filtering technique I've developed for state estimation and fault detection through graduate research at the University of Pittsburgh.

The main advantage of this algorithm is that it is able to quickly detect faults that occur suddenly with decent accuracy.  It detects faults faster and more accurately than other methodologies like multiple-model and interacting-multiple-model particle filtering.
